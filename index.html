                                    child divs, each with different styles applied—one child has box-sizing: border-box,
                                    while the other does not. The margin overlaps between the divs, but no other content

                                    spacing issues arise. The overflow: hidden property on the parent container hides

                                    vertically in a single column. On wider screens (minimum 40rem), the layout shifts
                                    to a 3-column, 2-row grid, with the first box (boxOne) spanning all three columns
                                    for emphasis. Each box has a unique background color, consistent padding, shadows,

                                    Grid, featuring four main boxes arranged into designated grid areas: header,
                                    sidebar, content, and footer. Box 3 (boxThree) is a nested grid that holds three
                                    internal content sections (box 3.1, box 3.2, and box 3.3), adapting from a single

                                    padding and border-radius for a polished UI. The entire layout is styled with a

                                    non-sequential grid areas. On smaller screens, all six boxes stack in a single
                                    column for mobile friendliness. Once the screen width exceeds 40rem, the layout
                                    shifts into a two-column grid where:

                                    Box 1 spans the full width of the top row.
                                    Box 2 stretches vertically across two rows in the left column.
                                    Box 3 and Box 5 span the entire row width independently.
                                    Box 4 and Box 6 are stacked vertically in the right column but separated by the grid
                                    row structure.
                                    This setup offers a dynamic, non-linear visual flow—perfect for magazine-style
                                    layouts, dashboards, or storytelling interfaces. Smooth scaling on hover and rounded
                                    edges help create a modern, interactive design feel.
