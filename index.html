                            <p>This file demonstrates foundational CSS concepts related to the Box Model, including the
                                roles of padding, margin, border, and width. It explores how total element size is
                                calculated differently when using the default box-sizing: content-box versus box-sizing:
                                border-box. The page includes styled elements for visual comparison and explanations
                                that illustrate how changes in padding and borders affect an element’s total rendered
                                size.

                                with Different Padding, Margin, and Overflow Behavior</a>
                            <p>This code demonstrates the behavior of nested div elements within a parent container,
                                focusing on their padding, margin, and overflow properties. The parent div contains two
                                child divs, each with different styles applied—one child has box-sizing: border-box,
                                while the other does not. The margin overlaps between the divs, but no other content or
                                spacing issues arise. The overflow: hidden property on the parent container hides any
                                content that extends beyond its bounds, behaving like a magician’s hat where content
                                appears and disappears.
