          Hi, I’m Aayush! I’m currently pursuing the Meta Front-End Developer
          Professional Certificate, where I’m building a strong foundation in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control. I enjoy learning by
          doing—whether it’s crafting responsive layouts with Flexbox or
          building projects like a web calculator from scratch. I’m focused on
          growing as a developer through hands-on practice, gradually increasing
          the complexity of my work while following best practices. Right now,
          I’m on a six-week journey to sharpen my front-end skills, one project
          at a time.
